## üìÇ User Story
As the Head of Human Resources, I want to use the HR dashboard to monitor employee performance and satisfaction across the company.
This dashboard should allow me to identify top-performing departments and low-performing ones based on key metrics such as Employee Satisfaction Score, Marital Status of Total Employee, Active and Terminated Employee, and Employee Recruitment Source.
With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which departments or teams to reward, where to allocate more support or training, and how to improve employee retention and engagement overall.

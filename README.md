## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

### üîç Data Exploration
Explored the dataset in Excel for:
- Inconsistencies and missing values
- Bugs or unusual characters
- Understanding column relationships

Initial insights:
- 12+ relevant columns
- Dataset is larger than needed

---

### üßπ Data Cleaning

**Goals:**
- Keep only relevant columns
- Clean text and remove nulls
- Convert codes to readable labels

| Property         | Description     |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Rows             | 312             |
| Columns          | 16              |

**Steps Taken:**
1. Dropped unnecessary columns  
2. Merged "Voluntarily Terminated" & "Terminated for Cause" as "Terminated"  
3. Renamed columns  
4. Converted `M` ‚Üí `Male`, `F` ‚Üí `Female`  
5. Translated satisfaction scores:  
   `1 = Very Low` to `5 = Very High`

###  Data Transformation 

## Analyze key Indicators 
### SQL query 
```sql

-- Total Employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Headcount FROM hrdata

-- Active Employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Active_Employees FROM hrdata WHERE EmploymentStatus = 'Active'

-- Terminated Employees
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN EmploymentStatus IN ('Voluntarily Terminated', 'Terminated for Cause') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Terminated_Employee FROM hrdata

-- 4) Total Male Employee: SELECT COUNT(*) AS Male FROM hrdata WHERE Gender = 'M'

-- 5) Total Female Employee: SELECT COUNT(*) AS Female FROM hrdata WHERE Gender = 'F'

CHARTS RQUIREMENT

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

-- Gender Breakdown
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) FROM hrdata GROUP BY Gender

-- Recruitment Source
SELECT RecruitmentSource, COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees FROM hrdata GROUP BY RecruitmentSource

-- Department Distribution
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees FROM hrdata GROUP BY Department

-- Marital Status
SELECT MaritalStatus, COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees FROM hrdata GROUP BY MaritalStatus

-- Satisfaction Levels
SELECT 
  CASE EmployeeSatisfaction
    WHEN 1 THEN 'Very Low'
    WHEN 2 THEN 'Low'
    WHEN 3 THEN 'Acceptable'
    WHEN 4 THEN 'High'
    WHEN 5 THEN 'Very High'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END AS Satisfaction_Level,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees
FROM hrdata
GROUP BY Satisfaction_Level

```
